LEARNING OBJECTIVES 
The aim of   this assignment is to provide students with the opportunity (working as   a team and as an individual)   to   learn   and   demonstrate   their   analytical   and   project   management   skills   through   the   development   of   an   information   technology   (IT)   project   management   case   study.   The   assignment   aims   to   assess   the   following   aspects of student   learning about   project   management:
●       Skills in communicating   projects.
●       Skills and   knowledge from the   Project   Performance   Domains
●       Working in   a   team.
SPECIFICATION AND   DELIVERABLES 
This   assignment   is based   on   the requirements   of   the   NexaForge   Studios.   Student   teams    undertaking   the   assignment   are   to   play   the   role   of   project   managers   within   an   IT   consultancy   that   NexaForge   Studios   has   contracted to   undertake a   portfolio   of   projects that are   intended to extend   sales   and   bring   in   new   customers   (see   below).
Note: students   will not be required to develop   a   product   as   part   of this process.While the assignment requires the team to work together and support each other to plan the delivery of these   projects, each team   member will   be   responsible for one   project. The   project   could   be the   one   they   proposed   in   their   Assignment   1   or,   could   be   a   new   topic   if   the   students   prefer   to   change   their   topic.   The   individual   component   of   the   assignment   will   be   assessed   based   on   the   work   submitted   in   Assignment   2   and   not   what   was   proposed   in Assignment   1.
SUBMISSION   INSTRUCTIONS 1.          The workshop topics   will address different components of the assignment and you should actively
participate and engage in the classes, discuss and work on   these as a team. Where required, present your   progress to the tutor, who will   provide support   and advice.
2.         There   are two written submissions:
a.      Group submission (Team Charter)   due Week   6   (Monday   26   August,   11:55   PM).
b.      Individual submission   (all   deliverables)   due Week   10   (Monday   30 September   2024,   11:55   PM).
3.          Submissions   (group and   individual)   must take the form. of   a   single   PDF   document.
a.      Group submission should   be   named: <>_<>.pdf.
b.      Individual submission should   be   named: <>_<>_<>.pdf.

ASSIGNMENT TEAMS
WHAT IS A TEAM PROJECT? 
A “Team Project” is NOT the same as a traditional “Group Project” . 
In a “Team Project” the members of a team work on closely related problems (in this case projects within a portfolio of maximum 4 projects). Students submit some work as a team, in this case, (a) the “Team 
Charter” . Students also submit other work as an individual, in this case, (b) the “Main Submission” (that is, all other components of the assignment). Even though the “Main Submission” is an individual piece of work, you are expected to work alongside the other members of your team in the unit’s applied sessions as a number of elements of the individual “Main submission” depend upon decisions that you make collectively as a team (e.g. how to navigate your projects towards the success of your portfolio). 
If, after reading the above, you are still unclear about the difference between a “Team Project” and a traditional “Group Project” then contact your tutor and/or Chief Examiner ([email   protected]).  This   assignment   requires   a   collaborative   effort   by   a   team   of   students   and   includes   both   a   team   submission   and   an   individual   submission.   Students   must form. their   teams   (from   attendees   of the   same tutorial/applied   learning session) and elect a team   leader to support the coordination of   activities. Students   should   form. their   teams   in   Week   4-5   applied   class   (no   later   than   Week   6).   Once   confirmed,   no   change   of   team   members   is   permitted   without   prior   approval   from   the   FIT5057   Chief   Examiner   (Dr.   Roisin   McNaney).   Students   should   form. teams of 4   (if   possible) or teams of 3   (if 4   is   not   possible, discuss with your tutor   if this is the   case).   If you   form   a team of 3   people then you will   still   need to   assume   that   you   are   splitting   any   budget   and   resources   (if   relevant)   between 4   individual   projects   (with the 4th   project   being a ‘future endeavour’).
Context and   Background 
YOUR TEAM You work in a project   management consultancy   partnership that   undertakes contracts   from   clients   and   works   with them to plan and manage internal service development   projects that include   IT   design   and   development.   The   projects   that you   plan   and   manage   are   implemented   by   a   combination   of the   client’s   staff   and   external   contractors that you source   through the   IT Contractor Rates Guide   by   HAYS (See the file uploaded to Moodle).In   phase   2   of   the   project,   your   client   has   revie代 写FIT5057 Project Management  Semester 2, 2024  Assignment TwoMatlab

You,   as   the   project   manager   of   one   of   the   successful   proposals,   are   now   asked to   join forces with up   to 3 other successful project managers and form. a   team to work towards achieving   portfolio   objectives   in   Assignments   2. Some   of you   have   already   formed   a team   during   phase   1   (assignment
1). You will continue to collaborate   with your   teams.
*   If you   do   not   have   a team at this stage   please   speak to   your   tutor.
THE   CLIENT 
NexaForge Studios   is a   market   leader   in the   Double-A gaming   industry.   NexaForge specialises   in crafting   mid-   market   video   games   that   blend   professional   development   expertise   with   the   creative   spirit   of   indie   studios.   Their    titles       resonate    with       a      broad      audience,      striking      a      balance      between      innovation    and       accessibility.   NexaForge’s clients comprise a diverse audience of gamers. They cater to console enthusiasts,   PC players,   and   mobile   gamers.   Their    mid-market   games    resonate    with   those   seeking   engaging   experiences    beyond   AAA   blockbusters.    NexaForge   holds   a   significant   market   share   in   the   Double-A   gaming   segment.   Their   focus   on   quality,   innovation, and accessible gameplay   sets them   apart from   their   competitors   including   other   Double-   A   studios,   indie   developers,   and   some   larger   non-indie   studios.   NexaForge   competes   by   delivering   polished   experiences without the extensive   budgets of AAA titles.
Their   current   annual   revenue   currently   stands   at   an   impressive   $120   million.   With   their   strategic   push   into   new   markets, they   anticipate further   growth.   Senior   management   is   expecting   a   17%   increase   over the   next3   years.   Through   innovation   and   expansion   to   their   game   offerings.   A   diversified   portfolio   attracts   different   player   demographics   and   opens   new   revenue   streams   Recognising   the   importance   of   player   retention,   they   set   another    KPI   to    increase   their    active    users    over   the    same    period.   They   expect   their    user    retention   to   increase:   (i)   Day   1   Retention   (D1) –   players who continue   playing after the first   day   increase from   the   current   30% to 45%;   (ii)   Day 7   Retention   (D7) –   players who continue   playing after the   first   week to   increase   from   the   current   12% to 30%; and   (iii) Three-Month   Retention (M3) –   players whose   interests   are   sustained   over   three   months to change the current   8%   to   16%.
THE CONTRACT After the recent commercial success of   their latest games, NexaForge executives have announced the creation   of   a   portfolio   package of   up to 4   projects to   extend sales   and   bring   in   new   customers.   They   have   dedicated   a   budget   of   $4.5M   to   spend   on   a   portfolio   of   up   to   four   projects   to   enter   new   markets   and   achieve   their   strategic goals of   increasing   revenue   and   increasing   player   retention.Some   technology   aspects   of   the   project,   such   as   providing   infrastructure   and   integrating   the   product   into   NexaForge’s   platforms, are to   be   implemented   by their   in-house team of experts.   However, all   the   remaining   costs   for   the   projects,   and   any   profit   that   your   partnership   intends   to   make,   must   come   out   of   the   $4.5M   budget.Note that the $4.5M   budget   is for the entire   portfolio   of   up to 4   projects and not just the one project you are proposing and   therefore,    it    is    important to budget carefully where all expected costs and expenses    are   justified   and   there   are   considerations   for   other   potential   projects   in   the   portfolio.   The   portfolio   of   projects   must be completed within 3 years of the contract start date. Your client   did   not specify the   expected   schedule   for each      individual project proposal; however, they expect the schedule, budget and scope of work
(requirements, deliverables,   delivery approach and cadence)   to   be   balanced   and feasible.
THE SUGGESTED   PROJECTS You can continue working on your proposed project from Assignment 1. However, if for any reason you prefer to change your topic, feel free to do so. You could choose one of the suggested    projects. The assessment of your submission will not be affected if you choose one of the suggested projects or change your topic from Assignment 1. 
Note: If you and a colleague in your team have previously chosen the same topics for Assignment 1, one (or both) of you are required to change their topic for Assignment 2. 
Project   1:   Eidolon’s Veil 
Eidolon’s   Veil   has   a   Surreal   exploration   and   puzzle   adventure   genre   that   transports   players   to   a   dreamlike   dimension   where    reality    blurs    with    imagination.   They    awaken    in    a    mysterious,    shifting   world:    a    place    of   forgotten memories, cryptic symbols, and hidden truths. The protagonist can   transform. into different forms   —   a shadow, a wisp of light, or even an ancient tree.   Each form. grants unique abilities. It includes symbolic   puzzle   solving   by   deciphering   ancient   glyphs,   manipulating   light   and   shadow,   and   altering   the   environment.   The   emotional explorations   uncover fragments of memories tied to   love,   loss, and   identity.   Its visual style   is   hand-
painted   landscapes that transition seamlessly   between   reality and abstraction.   Useful   references:

Project 3:   Retro   Rivals Retro   Rivals   has   an   arcade   racing   revival genre   and   has   Nostalgic Vibes.   Retro   Rivals taps   into the   '80s   arcade   racing   nostalgia.   Players   choose   classic   cars—sleek   muscle   cars,   neon-lit   speedsters,   and   quirky   go-karts.

Project 4: Stellar   Nexus Stellar   Nexus   is a Galactic   Odyssey following a Sci-fi   exploration   adventure   genre.      It   invites   players to   captain   their   starship   and   explore   a   procedurally   generated   galaxy.   Each   star   system   holds   secrets—ancient   ruins,   alien artefacts, and cosmic anomalies. Players can land on planets, engage in diplomacy with alien civilisations,   and uncover lost technologies.   Key features of this game are non-linear exploration where players follow their   instincts,    artistic    visuals    (hand-painted      environments), and      emotional      storytelling      that      unravel      personal   narratives   hidden   within   dreams.   The   game   doesn’t   rely   on   a   linear   narrative.   Instead,   players   encounter   dynamic events, forge alliances, and   influence the galactic   balance.   Players'   decisions   on   diplomacy,   trade,   or   conflict shape the galaxy’s   fate.
